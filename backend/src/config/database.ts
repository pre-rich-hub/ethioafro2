/**
 * Prisma's defaults are wrong for a serverless runtime, and wrong in a way that
 * only shows up once traffic arrives.
 *
 * A bare PrismaClient opens a pool of 5 connections with a 10 second timeout for
 * whatever asked for it. On Vercel every warm function instance is its own
 * process with its own pool, so ten idle instances hold fifty connections against
 * Neon, which is more than a small plan allows. The symptom is not a connection
 * error, it is `Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool`
 * under exactly the load the deploy was supposed to survive.
 *
 * Two corrections:
 *
 * One connection per instance. A function handles requests one at a time, so a
 * pool buys nothing, and a single connection is the smallest thing that can be
 * held open while the instance sits frozen between requests.
 *
 * A pool timeout longer than 10 seconds. Neon's scale-to-zero can take about 30
 * seconds to wake, and a short pool timeout turns that wake-up into a failure
 * instead of a wait.
